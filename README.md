I am an ambitious and detiermined Makers Academy graduate, confident in TDD using JavaScript and Ruby. I am passionate about learning, which is why I took the decision to pursue a career in Software Development. Makers has proven to be the perfect place to start my journey and learn skills that are valuable in the industry such as working on tech projects as part of a team, Object Oriented Design and the ability to learn any new technology I wish.

Since graduating Makers at the end of June, I have spent my time learning React and the MERN stack following tutorials and completing UDEMY courses. I am now working on a solo project for my portfolio "Popde" (Depop clone) which you can see at the top of my projects section. Although, it is still a working progress and there is still a lots of things to do before it is finished, I can now say I feel confident in my ability to build full stack CRUD applications on my own. 

# Background

Before I decided to pursue a career in tech, I had been working in various sales roles for 7+ years. 3 years ago I moved to London in order to further my career and was working as a customer-facing sales exec in the lucrative conference industry. I built relationships with C-Level executives across multiple industries and specialised in Pharmaceuitcal Development. I was successful and reguraly went above and beyond targets due to my work ethic and detiermination to succeed.

**Tech Stack**: JavaScript, React, Nodejs, Express, MongoDB, Postman, Ruby, SQL, HTML, CSS,  Sinatra, Rails,  Bootstrap, Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest, Enzyme, Cypress

# Skills

#### Excellent Communicator

In previous roles, my job has always centred around healthy discussion. Whether it is meeting with the sales team to discuss different approaches to campaigns or speaking one on one with clients to find out how we can help them achieve their business goals, communication has always been key to any succes I have had. 

At Makers it was no different, working in teams of 4-6 on projects planning sprints and problem solving on the go, it has been essential to hear everyones point of view in order to learn from others and overcome hurdles along the way.

#### Problem Solver

Problem solving is one of my favourite aspects of coding. I love getting stuck into a bug or implementing functionality that I am new to. For me it is the most important part of the learning process and I know that whilst I am trying to solve the issue, no time is wasted because I am simultaneously learning more about the code or tech I am working with. Of course once you do eventually fix the bug or implement the new functionality you feel great and you know where you went wrong, so you can make sure don't make the same mistakes again.

In my previous role, I was problem solving all day. Calling clients, finding out about their business plans and offering bespoke solutions to help them improve. If the solution did not match their needs or if I did not handle an objective correctly then would be the end of our discussion. It was all about finding out as much about the client as possible, so that you can find the right piece in the jigsaw and solve their problem.

#### InquisitiveÂ 

I love learning new things and Software Development gives me the opportunity to do this for the rest of my career which is extremely appealing to me. If it is a new piece of syntax or a different approach to a problem, I don't leave any stone unturned. I want to learn everthing there is to know about whatever it is I am involved in, right down to the finest details. It may mean that it might take me longer to do complete a task first time around, but I want to be confident that when I have completed said task, that I can replicate this going forward with minimal fuss. 

This is why when I finished Makers, that I decided to take a few months to carry on learning as opposed to diving straight into the job hunt. I felt there was things I missed out on first time around with bootcamp going so quickly. I wanted to make sure that when I do come to applying for jobs that I am 100% confident that I have grasped key concepts and I can make a full stack website on my own as opposed to part of a team. I can now and this is why I am ready to take the next step of my journey!

# Hobbies

I have been skateboarding over 15 years now. It is one of the most important things in my life and I owe it alot. From a young age, it taught me how to see the world creatively and how to push myself to achieve goals.

I am also a keen runner and cyclist in my spare time. I find it also really helps to keep the mind energised ready to code.
